Life is like sailing. I am a man in a boat, floating on the sea.

There is no single purpose to sailing. I can set a destination and go. Or I can simply roam around different parts of the sea. There are innumerable choices I can make.

There are also things I cannot change. Everyone's boat is different. Some people can change their boat, but others are not able to do so their entire lives. The environments where they start are different too. Someone might begin on a calm Hawaiian beach. Someone else might face tremendous waves in the Atlantic Ocean. It's all different. Yet, you can still go wherever you want.

Dat & Dot. They mean anchor and sail in Korean. They are the most important parts of a boat. Dat keeps the boat in position against the waves. Dot propels the boat toward the intended direction. Before departing to any destination, it's important to check for any problems with your Dat and Dot, and to become skilled at using them. Without them, the boat will be tossed by frightening tides and waves, or drift in the wrong direction. Even worse, you can end up further from your destination the harder you try—if the sail has problems.

These days, I feel like I'm on a sea with high and fierce waves. I want to cross this region. I could explain what these waves are in a clearer and more descriptive way, but it would get too long. The point is: I joined a new startup that is still in an early stage and not yet mature. It has many problems, with ongoing and urgent issues. I decided to join this company to experience these tides and waves. However, I feel like I'm affected too much by things happening daily. I'm being influenced more than I'm giving good influence. I feel like I need to drop anchor (dat) and make sure where I want to sail, then adjust my sail (dot).

It has been a long time since I've written a journal this long. I feel my thinking and writing skills have degraded. I cannot think structurally. My vocabulary and chain of thoughts are poor. Now I understand why I cannot think deeply—I've literally lost the ability to think.

I expect that writing journals and essays will be my Dat and Dot. Writing regularly will help me sail through this dangerous region and eventually reach where I want to be.
