## Starting Small

Three months ago, I committed to writing just 200 words every morning. No rules about what to write - just the act of putting thoughts on paper (or screen).

What started as a forced habit has become something I look forward to.

## What I've Learned

### Clarity Emerges Through Writing

There's something about externalizing thoughts that crystallizes them. Fuzzy ideas become clear. Problems that seemed overwhelming become manageable when broken down in writing.

### Patterns Become Visible

Looking back at entries from weeks ago, I notice recurring themes:
- What consistently energizes me
- What drains my motivation
- Which fears keep reappearing
- What I'm avoiding

This self-knowledge is invaluable.

### Memory Improves

By writing down experiences, I remember them better. My journal has become a secondary memory - a searchable archive of ideas, conversations, and insights.

## My Simple System

1. **Morning pages** - Stream of consciousness, no editing
2. **Evening reflection** - Three things that went well
3. **Weekly review** - Patterns and learnings

The key is consistency over quality. Some entries are profound; most are mundane. That's okay.

## Getting Started

If you're curious about journaling:

1. Start with just 5 minutes
2. Don't judge what you write
3. Keep it private (this removes self-censorship)
4. Make it a non-negotiable part of your routine

The benefits compound over time. Give it a month and see what changes.
